Description: A toolbox to make it easy to analyze plant disease epidemics. It
    provides a common framework for plant disease intensity data recorded over
    time and/or space. Implemented statistical methods are currently mainly
    focused on spatial pattern analysis (e.g., aggregation indices, Taylor and
    binary power laws, distribution fitting, SADIE and mapcomp methods). See
    Madden LV, Hughes G, van den Bosch F (2007, ISBN: 978-089054-354-2) for
    further information on these methods. Several data sets that were mainly
    published in plant disease epidemiology literature are also included in this
    package.
